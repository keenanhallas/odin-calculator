## The Odin Project Foundations course final project

### Project Goals:
With this being the final project of the Odin Project foundations course, the goals of this project span the entire set of topics covered so far. There will be many skills that need to be utilized here, and those will be outlined below, but first: a reminder to myself regarding healthy outlook:

- This project will serve as a fantastic encapsulation of everything I've learned so far, and, upon completion, will be a milestone I should be proud of. But this is still just the end of the beginning, and I must go easy on myself for still having much to learn. Any mistakes or struggles are a natural part of the process. Enjoy that process!

Now, on to the high level topics I hope to focus on while completing this project:

- Continued use of a problem solving framework, and emphasizing this becoming a habit in my workflow moving forward. This includes understanding the problem fully (being able to explain it in simple English), planning the inputs, outputs, and user interface, pseudocoding the algorithm logic before writing any code, and dividing the problem into manageable chunks
- Clean organization of the file structure & code, and separation of concerns between HTML, CSS, & JS achieved through this organization
- Building the project piece by piece, and testing as I go, as well as committing with each small step completed
- Use of both typing vanilla HTML as well as using DOM methods to define & alter the structure of the page
- Use of both CSS & DOM methods to apply styling to elements & the DOM tree, including proper organization of CSS declarations
- Use of the CSS display property and layout flows such as Normal and FlexBox to properly layout the project
- Use of event listeners to add the relevant interactivity to the page
- Breaking down JS code into functions when necessary, to keep code readable, modular, and organized
- Proper simple use of arrays & objects, and their associated methods, as required by the program logic & data needs
- Solidifying my overall knowledge of and comfort with using JS
- Trying to use a more methodical approach to debugging, rather than using simple console.logs
- The continued practice of googling for solutions when stuck
